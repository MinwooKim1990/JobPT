Title : Wipro Neural Intelligence Platform
Team Size : 5
Brief: Wipro’s Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence
technologies—natural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and
unstructured data sources; an “intent assessment and reasoning” engine that includes sentiment and predictive
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be
eliminated.
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU api’s and machine learning using
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best
suited response and make the system efficient.
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities
using Keras TensorFlow framework.

Thank you for your interest in one of the fastest growing franchises in
America, Walk-On's Sports Bistreaux. Every position from the host stand to the

you wanting more. Our passion for food and fun are on display every day, and
we need you to help us win championships! At Walk-On's we value team
camaraderie, and we play for the name on the front not the back.

Our Server position gives team members an opportunity to work in a fast paced,
team-oriented, gameday atmosphere taking care of our guests.

Server opportunities are offered in a part time capacity. Flexible hours and
scheduling are available, which is great for the busy student or anyone who
has outside obligations. Room for advancement on the team is always a
possibility for the right team member!

 **Requirements/Responsibilities**

  * Ability to lift 25 lbs.
  * Ability to stand for 10+ hours
  * Ability to adhere to uniform guidelines
  * Ability to memorize floor chart, table numbers, and steps of service
  * Have reliable form of transportation

Must possess the following qualities:

  * Winning personality
  * Consistent positive attitude
  * Team work mentality
  * Fluent in English

Previous restaurant or customer service experience is not required but is
preferred.

**Position Classification**

The position for which you are being considered is a part-time position,
which, for purposes of the federal health reform law, satisfies federal
standards. Under those federal standards, work is part-time if someone works
29 hours or less a week on average. This average is not calculated on a week-
by-week basis. Instead, a measurement period, also known as a look back
period, is used to determine the average hours an employee works per week.
Work hours may fluctuate from time-to-time depending on business needs and how
hours are scheduled. Simply because hours may increase from time-to-time does
not mean the position ceases to be a part-time position; it does not mean the
position is full-time for benefits or other purposes. Variation in hours is
part of the job position and may be such that you work well over 30 hours per
week for an extended time. All changes to full-time positions will be
documented with a formal notice; in the absence of that designation by us, a
change has not occurred.

Federal law states that an employer is to measure its employees' hours worked
to determine possible future health plan eligibility; therefore, if you are
hired, we will track any hours worked over a 12-month period starting with the
first day of the first month following the date of hire. If, at the end of the
12 months you are then determined to be eligible, you will be offered plan
coverage at that time for the _following_ 12 months. (Coverage is never
available retroactively.)","--- Example CV format ---

corporate headquarters have one thing in common: the opportunity to advance
their career. We proudly hire and promote from our own ranks, offering
opportunities to learn and advance, take trainings and earn degrees, serve our
communities, receive recognition for their work and have a career, not just a
job.

groups that help build community and are aligned with our mission, values,
goals, business practices and objectives. The BRGs programming is designed to
support their members and our associates through social activity, volunteering
and professional development opportunities.  
Our mission is to provide convenient ways for our customers to prepare meals
for moments that matter most through meal solutions, recipe inspiration, time-
saving services like pickup and delivery and beyond. Giant also values being a
better neighbor. One way we support our neighbors is by providing donations
and charitable efforts to our local partners that support our main charitable
causes.
