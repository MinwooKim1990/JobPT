**Benefits**
 Northstrat values true work life balance. We offer power of choice benefits designed to best meet the needs of you and your lifestyle. Our benefits programs are designed to support and encourage wellness, healthy living, retirement investment, and lifetime learning.
   

  

**Pay Range**
 There are a host of factors that can influence final salary including, but not limited to, geographic location, Federal Government contract labor categories and contract wage rates, relevant prior work experience, specific skills and competencies, education, and certifications. We also offer competitive compensation, benefits, and professional development opportunities. Please refer to our Benefits section for additional details.
   

  

**Flex Time**
 Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John's IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.
   

  

**Individual Benefits Account (IBA)**
 To attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset \\- the employee.
   

  

 The purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full\\-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as:
   

  

 IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee's monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee's salary.
   

  

**Profit Sharing Plan (PSP)**
 The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee's behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee's compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.
   

  

**Stock Options**
 Because Northstrat is an employee\\-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.
   

  

**Lifelong Learning**
 Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work\\-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.
   

  

**Join Our Talented Team**
 We hire the BEST employees and value each one. Since 2021, The Washington Post has recognized Northstrat among its ""Top Workplaces"". We think that your friends and family will like it here too, so we offer employee referral incentives.

**The Roku Culture** 
  


 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 


  


 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

description - ","Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.
   

  

 So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.
   

  

 Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise\\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.
 


  

**The Role** 
  


 We’re looking for a visionary 
 **Head of Brand \\& Content Marketing** 
 to lead the next chapter of the Square brand. This leader will be a steward for how millions of businesses \\- from coffee shops to complex national brands \\- experience and connect with Square. You'll shape our brand strategy \\& narrative, define the brand foundations — positioning, messaging, identity, and metrics (in partnership with the Insights and Creative teams) —and ensure it shows up with clarity and impact across EVERY touchpoint. You’ll also lead the content strategy that scales our narrative globally.

* A demonstrated interest in responsible technology and/or AI governance
* Excellent analytical, writing, and communication skills in English
* The ability to work independently and collaboratively in an interdisciplinary setting


Whether your strengths lie in technical development, empirical investigation, legal analysis, socio\\-technical system design, or somewhere else, we encourage you to apply.


**Responsibilities**


* Take ownership of a defined research direction aligned with the group's themes, working with a high degree of independence and initiative.
* Conduct research using methods appropriate to the project and your background — including empirical, qualitative, quantitative, or systems\\-based approaches — and develop tools, prototypes, or other artefacts to explore and demonstrate key ideas.

The experience is detailed with durations (30 months in core skills, 18 months for WordPress/PHP, etc.) and multiple relevant roles, meeting the 2+ years requirement, leading to a solid experience score.
While the resume mentions collaboration and client project work, it lacks direct references to cultural values such as honoring God and making a positive difference, so the culture fit score is moderately lower.
The overall resume is structured and readable despite minor typos (e.g., 'Exprience') leading to a good readability score.
However, several sentences (e.g., about developing responsive websites and customizing WordPress themes) are very similar to the JD wording, causing it to closely paraphrase the job description, which forces the generation score to be set at 30 as per guidelines."

### **Who we are:**


**Hyperheat** is a young Climate Tech start\\-up with experienced founders and the goal of developing a renewable heat solution for energy\\-intensive industries. Basic industrial products, such as steel, cement, chemicals, glass, and paper, form the material basis of modern societies. However, the heat demand for their production is responsible for around 20% of human CO2 emissions (or 7,5 Gt CO2 each year) due to burning fossil fuels — therefore, it is one of the last major sectors without attractive, sustainable decarbonization solutions yet.



Hyperheat's products will provide a complete temperature range of up to 2000°C, making it a replacement for almost every gas burner in the industry. **Our solution will be more cost\\-effective than the fossil state of the art, contributing to a new basis for global prosperity.** At the heart of the development is a durable and cost\\-effective electric heater that can provide industrial process heat 24/7 from PV and wind power when combined with thermal storage.


### **Hiring Process**



Our hiring process is entirely remote, conducted via email and video chat for seamless communication.


* Initial 1:1 screening call with a hiring manager.
* Completion of a relevant take\\-home task to simulate actual work.
* Skill \\& Team interview with prospective team members.


At HyperHeat, we care deeply about inclusive working practices and diverse teams, so we particularly encourage applications from different under\\-represented demographics. If you'd prefer to work part\\-time or as a job\\-share, we'll facilitate this wherever we can – whether to help you meet other commitments or to help you strike a great work\\-life balance. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description.","Technical Skills • Languages: Python, MATLAB, C++ • Primary Skill: Thermal & CFD Simulation Modeling • Tools Used: ANSYS Mechanical, ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS CFX

Campfire is a social\\-first marketing agency that helps brands break through by creating content that actually works on social—not repurposed ads, not TV\\-style creative, but real, platform\\-native content that people want to engage with. We specialise in influencer marketing, organic social, and content creation, working with some of the biggest brands in beauty and beyond.



We don’t believe in one\\-size\\-fits\\-all content. Every platform has its own culture, trends, and mechanics—and we create content that **fits, not fights, the platform**. That’s why we produce everything from **fast\\-turnaround lo\\-fi TikTok content** to **high\\-production\\-value social shoots**, always through a **social\\-first lens**.

  


**Role Overview**



We’re looking for a **Head of Content (Social\\-First)** who truly gets social media—someone who instinctively understands the cultures, styles, and formats that make content succeed on each platform. This isn’t about just making ‘good content’—it’s about making **the right content for the right platform at the right time**.



You’ll lead Campfire’s **content team**, shaping our creative approach, pushing our work to new levels, and ensuring that every piece of content we produce is **designed to perform**—whether it’s a raw, reactive TikTok or a high\\-end shoot designed for maximum impact on Instagram. You’ll be hands\\-on with strategy, execution, and talent development, ensuring our content is not just visually strong, but **culturally on\\-point, platform\\-native, and results\\-driven**.

  


**Key Responsibilities****Creative Leadership \\& Strategy**


* **Define and drive Campfire’s creative approach** to social\\-first content, ensuring we create work that **feels native to the platform, not adapted for it**.
* **Develop content strategies** that balance **lo\\-fi, creator\\-led formats with high\\-end, premium production**, always keeping social\\-first principles at the core.
* **Stay ahead of platform changes and trends**, ensuring our clients are always ahead of the curve—not catching up.
* **Push the boundaries of what social\\-first content can be**, championing a mix of reactive, trend\\-driven creativity and long\\-term brand\\-building storytelling.


**Content Creation \\& Execution**


* **Oversee the production of both fast\\-turnaround, lo\\-fi content** (TikTok trends, short\\-form video, reactive content) and **high\\-production shoots optimised for social\\-first performance**.
* **Work closely with influencers and creators** to develop highly engaging content that feels **authentic, platform\\-native, and in tune with audience behaviour**.
* **Ensure that every piece of content is designed to perform**—not just to look good, but to **drive real engagement, reach, and action**.
* **Lead on experimentation**, constantly testing new content formats, styles, and techniques to refine our approach.


**Leadership \\& Team Development**


* **Manage and mentor a team of social\\-first content strategists, writers, and creators**, helping them develop cutting\\-edge skills in content production and platform strategy.
* **Foster a culture of speed, creativity, and experimentation**, ensuring we move fast and create work that leads the industry.
* **Ensure we have the right mix of talent and resources** to deliver both high\\-volume, fast\\-moving content and more considered, high\\-production\\-value shoots.


**Collaboration \\& Client Engagement**


* **Work closely with clients** to help them understand what truly works on social (and challenge them when needed).
* **Collaborate across departments** (strategy, influencer, paid, organic) to ensure content is maximised across all relevant platforms.
* **Be a thought leader in social\\-first content**, both internally and externally—pushing for better creative thinking in the industry.


**What We’re Looking For**


* Someone who **lives and breathes social**—you naturally get what works on TikTok, Instagram, and beyond, and you understand the **platform\\-specific mechanics of content performance**.
* A deep understanding of **how to balance lo\\-fi, creator\\-led content with high\\-production\\-value storytelling**, always keeping social\\-first in mind.
* A **proven track record of leading social\\-first content teams**, whether at an agency, brand, or creator\\-led environment.
* Experience in **managing both fast\\-moving reactive content and structured, high\\-end content production**.
* A **data\\-driven creative mindset**—you understand not just what looks good, but what performs.
* Strong leadership and mentoring skills, with the ability to **build and inspire a high\\-performance team**.
* The ability to **confidently challenge clients and internal teams**, ensuring we always push for the best social\\-first creative possible.


**What Success Looks Like**


* Campfire is known for **creating the best, most effective social\\-first content**—whether that’s a trend\\-driven TikTok, a polished campaign shoot, or anything in between.
* Our clients see real results—**higher engagement, deeper audience connection, and measurable business impact**.
* Our content team operates at a world\\-class level, **balancing speed, creativity, and strategic thinking**.
* We’re not just reacting to trends—we’re **setting them**.


**Campfire isn’t looking for a traditional creative lead—we’re looking for someone who** **sees social as the main event****. If that’s you, let’s talk.**","Education Details

-----------------


At Google, we follow a simple but vital premise: ""Focus on the user and all else will follow."" Google’s Interaction Designers take complex tasks and make them intuitive and easy\\-to\\-use for billions of people around the globe. Throughout the design process—from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes—you’ll envision how people will experience our products, and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined, and even magical.  

  

Google User Experience (UX) is made up of multi\\-disciplinary teams of UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Content Strategists, Program Managers, and Engineers: we care deeply about the people who use our products. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering insights about the attitudes, emotions, and behaviors of people who use our products to inspire and inform design. We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry\\-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses.  

  

As an Interaction Designer, you’ll rely on user\\-centered design methods to craft industry\\-leading user experiences—from concept to execution. Like all of our UX jobs, you’ll collaborate with your design partners to leverage and evolve the Google design language to build beautiful, innovative, inspired products that people love to use.

* Be comfortable with a less rigid, adaptable product development process, suited for building early\\-stage concepts, gathering user insights, and continuously exploring, pivoting, learning, and iterating based on feedback and data.
* Conduct lightweight internal research or usability studies, develop detailed wireframes, create high\\-fidelity visual designs, and build rapid (Figma) prototypes that effectively communicate key ideas, user journeys, and interaction decisions.
* Demonstrate a deep understanding of user\\-centered design principles, and leverage insights from UX research to inform design output and showcase multimodal AI capabilities.
* Articulate user needs and design rationale clearly, advocate the user perspective and ensure design solutions align with user goals, technical feasibility, and driving user adoption of Google AI.

While the resume reflects relevant responsibilities and project work (notably migrating legacy systems to .NET Core and mentoring teams), the total experience appears limited (24 months in the senior role) compared to expectations for a senior position, slightly reducing the experience score.
The resume highlights collaboration and technical leadership but lacks explicit references to the cultural values (inclusivity, personal development, and safe play) emphasized in the JD, leading to a moderate culture fit score.
The overall layout and bullet formatting make the resume easy to read and understand, warranting a high readability score.
The resume is well-structured with a clear focus on required skills, and while it touches upon similar themes as the JD, it avoids close paraphrasing, resulting in a strong generation score."

----------------


There are 20 million single family residences (SFRs) in the United States, more than 19 million of which are owned by 15\\.5 million “very small investors,” individuals or families who own one or two units. For these rental property owners, there is little in the way of data or technology to help them understand the market rental rates for their property, find and market to the highest quality prospective tenants, and manage the ongoing maintenance of their rental units with minimal headache. Pain points like these are why more than a third of all SFR owners turn to property managers for help.


Full\\-service property management for SFRs is a hyper\\-local and highly fragmented business. And just like the owners, property managers have little in the way of data, tools, and automated processes to enable them to scale and work smartly. Further, there is a misalignment of incentives between traditional property managers and the owners they represent – managers can promise a high rental rate to win the business, but do so without consequence if they secure a lower rate. They pitch fast leasing timeframes but have no skin in the game when vacancies stretch from weeks to months. Missteps on both of these fronts come at a high cost; they often are the difference between a homeowner making or losing money on their rental property each year.

  

**Our Company**
---------------


Doorstead is here to address these pain points and more which have long been considered “unfixable” by property owners. Doorstead is a full\\-service, technology\\-operations driven property manager that supports the two\\-sided marketplace of owners and tenants. For owners, we eliminate uncertainty by leveraging an upfront pricing model to set list price based on real\\-time, localized supply and demand. We invested early in building local data sets and machine learning models, leveraging hundreds of variables for a given home to predict market\\-clearing rents that minimize vacancy, maximize owner cash flow, and align incentives of the owner and property manager.


In 5 years of operations, we've booked $60M\\+ gross rents, indexed rental prices for over 10MM properties, and raised \\~$38M from the investors who backed Redfin with participation from executives at Opendoor and Uber. Without that winning team, we would not be where we are today.

  

**The Role**
------------


We are looking for a Licensed Real Estate Broker in Virginia. As our broker, you will help launch our Virginia brokerage and oversee our real estate activities. We're looking for someone who is excited about joining a high\\-growth startup in property management and has an affinity for technology and change. This is a part\\-time and remote role

Can you write decent PHP code that you’re proud to explain \\- not just *what* it does, but *why* you did it that way? (We’ll forgive that one legendary function that you once wrote at 2am that no one, including you, fully understands, but it *just works perfectly*).

Can the majority of your code be merged without causing the other members of your team to require anger management classes/blood pressure medication?

Can you defend the quality of your code with regard to security, efficiency, and maintainability \\- without the use of tears and/or excessive violence?

Can you confidently read, understand, and constructively critique other people’s code \\- even that one developer who writes everything like they’re constantly practising for the International Obfuscated C Contest?

And if you ever use an AI\\-assisted tool, do you treat the output as though it was written by a hyper\\-caffeinated junior dev with questionable loyalties \\- and make it *actually safe* for production?

If, and only if, you’ve answered YES to all of the above \\- here’s the rest:

**What You’ll Be Doing:**

* Developing internal tools and customer\\-facing systems, writing clean, maintainable PHP code to build and improve back\\-end services and APIs that power our web applications and internal systems.
* Collaborating with front\\-end and full\\-stack developers to deliver features that are secure, efficient, and great to use.
* Contributing to the design and architecture of new features and systems.
* Taking ownership of your work, and pride in what you do \\- from scoping and estimating to development, testing, and deployment.
* Troubleshooting, debugging and fixing real\\-world problems (not just adding “try/catch” and hoping for the best). Digging into bug reports, logs, and manually testing to figure out *what actually happened* \\- and helping make sure it won’t happen again.
* Reviewing and critiquing pull requests to provide positive feedback to both improve the code and help level up the team’s skills.
* Shipping robust, high quality code quickly, without cutting corners.
* Working on both legacy systems and green field projects \\- helping shape the architecture of new systems and yes, occasionally yelling “Why?!” at legacy code, then taking a breath, grabbing a coffee and refactoring it cleanly.

**What We’re Looking For:**

* 3\\+ years of experience writing and maintaining PHP code.
* Strong understanding of OOP, SOLID principles, and clean, maintainable architecture.
* Experience building and maintaining RESTful APIs and back\\-end services for web applications.
* Solid grasp of secure coding practices, performance tuning, and efficient database interaction (e.g. MySQL/PostgreSQL).
* Ability to collaborate well within a growing development team, reviewing and giving constructive feedback on pull requests.
* Good problem solving and software design skills.
* Familiarity with version control (Git), automated testing, and CI/CD pipelines.
* Comfortable working in a hybrid or remote team, managing your own time and communicating clearly.

**Nice to have:**

* Experience working with Docker, cloud platforms (AWS), or containerized dev environments.
* Familiarity with headless CMS platforms or content APIs.
* Some front\\-end skills or awareness (even if it’s just enough to appreciate your teammates' pain getting that last div to align properly on mobile).

**Why Join Us?**

* You’ll be a key voice in shaping how we build, test, and ship software.
* Work on a mix of internal tools and public\\-facing apps, where your work has a direct tangible impact.
* Collaborate with a thoughtful, experienced team who care about shipping good code without the crunch.
* You’ll have space to work independently, and suggest better ways of doing things.
* Flexible working, a relaxed but focused culture, and support for your professional development.
