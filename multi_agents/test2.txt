유저 질문: LaTeX, Weka 등 툴을 ML 개발툴 관점에서 확장 설명 유도
유저 선택 부분: Technical Skills
• Tools: LaTeX for academic paper writing; Weka for machine learning experiments
최종 답변
LaTeX와 Weka를 포함한 툴들을 머신러닝(ML) 개발툴 관점에서 확장하여 설명해 보겠습니다.

1. LaTeX  
LaTeX는 주로 문서 작성에 사용되는 도구이지만, ML 개발 과정에서 중요한 역할을 할 수 있습니다. 연구 논문, 보고서, 실험 결과를 체계적이고 전문적으로 작성하는 데 최적화되어 있어, ML 모델 개발 후 결과 공유 및 문서화에 필수적입니다. 또한, 수식 표현과 그래프 삽입이 용이해 복잡한 알고리즘 설명이나 데이터 분석 결과를 명확하게 전달할 수 있습니다.

2. Weka  
Weka는 데이터 마이닝과 머신러닝을 위한 오픈소스 소프트웨어로, 다양한 ML 알고리즘을 GUI 환경에서 쉽게 적용해 볼 수 있습니다. 데이터 전처리, 분류, 회귀, 클러스터링, 시각화 등 ML 개발의 전 과정을 지원하며, 초보자부터 전문가까지 폭넓게 활용됩니다. 특히, 프로그래밍 지식이 부족한 사용자도 손쉽게 ML 모델을 실험하고 평가할 수 있어 교육용 및 프로토타입 개발에 적합합니다.

이처럼 LaTeX는 ML 결과물의 문서화와 공유 측면에서, Weka는 ML 모델 개발과 실험 측면에서 각각 중요한 역할을 하며, ML 개발툴 생태계 내에서 상호 보완적인 위치를 차지합니다.
