유저 질문: LaTeX, Weka 등 툴을 ML 개발툴 관점에서 확장 설명 유도
유저 선택 부분: Technical Skills
• Tools: LaTeX for academic paper writing; Weka for machine learning experiments
최종 답변
LaTeX와 Weka를 포함한 다양한 툴을 머신러닝(ML) 개발툴 관점에서 확장하여 설명해 보겠습니다.

1. LaTeX  
LaTeX는 주로 문서 작성에 사용되는 도구이지만, ML 개발 과정에서 중요한 역할을 할 수 있습니다. 연구 논문, 보고서, 실험 결과 정리 등에서 수식 표현과 깔끔한 문서 작성이 필수적이기 때문에, ML 연구자와 개발자들이 결과를 체계적으로 기록하고 공유하는 데 매우 유용합니다. 또한, LaTeX는 코드와 수식을 함께 관리할 수 있어 재현 가능한 연구 환경 구축에 도움을 줍니다.

2. Weka  
Weka는 데이터 마이닝과 머신러닝을 위한 오픈소스 소프트웨어로, 다양한 알고리즘과 시각화 도구를 제공합니다. ML 개발툴로서 Weka는 초보자부터 전문가까지 쉽게 사용할 수 있는 GUI 환경을 제공하며, 데이터 전처리, 분류, 회귀, 클러스터링 등 다양한 ML 작업을 지원합니다. 또한, Java 기반으로 확장성과 커스터마이징이 가능해 연구 및 프로토타입 개발에 적합합니다.

이처럼 LaTeX는 ML 연구 및 결과 문서화 측면에서, Weka는 ML 모델 개발과 실험 측면에서 각각 중요한 역할을 하며, 두 툴 모두 ML 개발 생태계에서 상호 보완적인 도구로 활용될 수 있습니다.
