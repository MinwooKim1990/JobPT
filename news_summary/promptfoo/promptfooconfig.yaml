      Nick Scholfield has been lined up to ride Jim Culloty’s Spring Heeled in the

      Scholfield had been expected to partner Paul Nicholls-trained Sam Winner, who

      Scholfield, who has ridden in six Nationals and finished third in 2013 on Teaforthree,

    text: '"It''s all about taking an opportunity in a crisis," says the outgoing
      Conservative leader of Melton Borough Council.


      Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It''s full
      of light. It''s busy.


      The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray''s railway station,
      once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for
      free.


      Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre.


      It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices
      on the other side of town.


      A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting
      the council on a firm financial footing.


      But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It''s being
      experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which
      threaten the services they provide.


      Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility
      for finance.


      Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because
      of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since
      the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped.


      At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business
      rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central
      government.


      It''s the grant cut which is causing them grief.


      What''s called the "core funding" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied
      by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling.


      If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by
      2019/20.


      Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with
      £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354.


      "The funding system is chaotic," says Byron Rhodes.


      "It doesn''t reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting
      example," he says with a glint in his eye.


      Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council
      about cutbacks to services there?


      "If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we''d have £50m a year extra. If
      we had the same as Surrey, we''d have £100m more. We''d be partying everyday
      if we had that kind of money."


      Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what''s been called transitional
      funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative
      MPs.


      Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only  17 in the
      Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled.


      Last month there would''ve been another rebellion, including some of our own
      Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn''t done to improve the local
      government finance settlement over the next four years.


      The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread
      over two years, enough to save some services from closure.


      But it''s a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the
      budget every year after the latest cutbacks.


      Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are
      Conservative-run. Many Labour-run authorities such as Derby, Leicester and Nottingham,
      got nothing.


      The leader of Derby City Council, Ranjit Banwait, has launched a "fair funding
      for Derby" campaign. He says the allocation of government funding is unfair
      and political and the cuts they''re having to impose on leisure services and
      culture are devastating.


      "Now they are threatening our ability to protect the vulnerable and our ability
      to function is under threat," said Mr Banwait.


      Back in Melton Mowbray, Byron Rhodes has some sympathy for the Labour council
      in Derby.


      "Derby probably have some greater needs," he says.


      But once more he is talking about seizing an opportunity in a crisis.


      Leicestershire''s finance team are working on a submission to put to the government
      with good arguments on how to restructure the way funds are allocated.


      "We''re going to do it. We''re going to work up a system which is fairer."


      He has the backing of local MPs and is talking to neighbouring authorities.


      And with a hand out to Derby, he says: "If they want to talk to us about how
      to improve things I''m happy to speak to them."


      It''s a crucial time to get things right. The government is moving to a system
      where, by 2020, the grant will go.


      Councils will instead get an allocation of funds from the business rates instead.


      How they come up a formula for doing that in a fair way, which helps those authorities
      with most need, is the next challenge.'

      \ meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales.\n\nVERDICT: This looks impressive — a\
      \ huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in\
      \ the middle, sparkling like a jewel.\n\nThe Fortnum & Mason label adds to the\
      \ impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the\
      \ honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.\n\nThe chewy mass is like old\
      \ gum. I spit it out — as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes\
      \ no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that\
      \ paying more doesn’t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb\
      \ Starflower Honey.\n\n£19.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: The starflower\
      \ is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But\
      \ this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used\
      \ to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin\
      \ diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes\
      \ heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can’t see the\
      \ chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds\
      \ it isn’t transparent.\n\nI’ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself,\
      \ but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles\
      \ delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not\
      \ totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its\
      \ bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion.\

      \ while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.\n\nChestnut\
      \ Honey.\n\n£6.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: A dark, runny honey\
      \ with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers\
      \ of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite\
      \ among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes.\n\nVERDICT: After\
      \ tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown,\
      \ treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My\
      \ children didn’t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to\
      \ serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you\
      \ want something completely different. 3/5.\n\nChestnut Honey is a dark, runny\

      £20 for 227g, Fortnum & Mason.


      PROMISE: The Duchess’s late-spring honey is made from ‘delicately perfumed nectar
      with subtle hints of chamomile’ and billed as ‘the ideal accompaniment to ice
      cream on hot summer days, or for sweetening tea’. All proceeds go to the Medical
      Detection Dogs charity, of which the Duchess is patron.


      VERDICT: This tastefully packaged little jar, decorated with a pretty drawing
      of a pink flower and bee, has a handwritten number on the back. It contains
      a clear, golden, liquid honey, and when I open the jar a delicate smell of flowers
      greets my nostrils. When you ooze it over buttered bread, it’s impossible to
      stop eating. Delicate, delicious and the perfect gift for any honey-lover. A
      royal winner. 5/5.


      Royal winner: Camilla’s honey is made from ‘delicately perfumed nectar with
      subtle hints of chamomile''


      Duchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey.


      £5.10 for 227g, Waitrose.


      PROMISE: Heathers growing on the Crown Estate in Balmoral produce the nectar
      for this honey. Beekeepers prize heather honey for its unique taste, and this
      is a combination of two types of heather, Bell and Ling.


      VERDICT: Open the jar and just smell the heather aroma before you taste this
      golden delight. Camilla may have set the bar high but Prince Charles’s answer
      is also rather beautiful and rare. It has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and
      a strong but fabulous taste. 3/5.


      Duchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey has a thick, velvety, sugary texture
      and a strong but fabulous taste.


      Wedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey.


      £14.95 for 325g, wedderspoon.co.uk.


      PROMISE: Wild Rata trees grow on high land in New Zealand. They flower sporadically,
      so the nectar is extremely rare. The honey is kept at a low temperature — the
      same as that of a beehive — to preserve natural enzymes, antioxidants, vitamins
      and minerals.


      VERDICT: Did you ever think honey could taste like a Christmas tree? Take one
      gulp of this delicious amber nectar and, seconds later, a subtle taste of pines
      will dance on your tongue. This creamy, firm-set honey scooped a place in the
      top 50 products (out of 10,000) in the ‘food Oscars’, the Great Taste Awards.
      Now I’ve tried it, that comes as no surprise. 4/5.


      Wedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey scooped a place in the top 50 products in
      the ‘food Oscars’


      Tregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka.


      £29.95 for 113g, tregothnan.co.uk.


      PROMISE: Although manuka is generally expensive, this is a more normal-tasting
      version and Britain’s costliest home-grown honey. Most manuka plants grow in
      New Zealand but bushes have been growing, hidden behind a garden wall, on the
      Tregothnan estate in Cornwall since 1880.


      Bees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park
      and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art, six-foot hives, which cost
      £5,000 each. There is only a limited supply made, hence the hefty price tag.


      VERDICT: This honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every teaspoon
      is expensive. Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among
      honey fans.


      The jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust.
      Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised
      sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests
      raved about it. A treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. 4/5.


      Tregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars,
      so every spoonful is pricey.


      Vasilissa Greek Honey with Edible Gold Leaf.


      £39.99 for 250g, selfridges.co.uk.


      PROMISE: Produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of Evia, this
      honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food
      bling.


      The small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom, infusing it
      with the flavour of the herb. Greek honey is said to be among the best in the
      world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and
      ancient, organic production methods.


      VERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover.
      It looks so good, I don’t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight.


      The beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew
      the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume.


      Inside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who
      hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each
      one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they
      call honey the food of the gods. 5/5.


      Vasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the
      ultimate in food bling.


      Alemany Rosemary Honey.


      £7.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.


      PROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the
      same traditional methods after five generations.


      The nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains,
      and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to
      be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation.


      VERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in
      for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised
      honey at the sides. It’s very mild — there is no strong aroma and the rosemary
      flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls.


      It does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby’s
      favourite honey — she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double
      consistency. 4/5.


      Alemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot
      of the Montsec mountains.


      Welsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora.


      £21 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason.


      PROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb
      adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and
      hedgerows in mid-Wales.


      VERDICT: This looks impressive — a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey
      and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel.


      The Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment,
      then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.


      The chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out — as does my honey-loving son
      Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey
      we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn’t always guarantee a pot of gold.
      1/5.


      Heather Honeycomb Starflower Honey.


      £19.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.


      PROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much
      less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium.
      It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat
      skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes
      heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.


      VERDICT: You can’t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because
      the pale honey that surrounds it isn’t transparent.


      I’ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast
      will never be the same again.


      It crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny
      but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with
      its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion.
      4/5.


      Heather Honeycomb Starflower Honey crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while
      the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.


      Chestnut Honey.


      £6.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.


      PROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This
      is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter,
      savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant
      depth to dishes.


      VERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock.
      A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut
      aroma. My children didn’t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits
      to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you
      want something completely different. 3/5.


      Chestnut Honey is a dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas.'

    text: 'Aubrey de Grey (pictured) says ageing is a ''disease that can and should
      be cured''


      With his Rasputin beard and lines etched deep into his forehead, Aubrey de Grey
      looks like a man a lot older than his 51 years. A penchant for beer, fried food
      and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public
      schoolboy cares little about ageing.


      But you would be wrong.


      For de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist,
      firmly believes there is no reason, with the right ''therapies'', why any of
      us shouldn''t reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age.


      It sounds bonkers but de Grey''s theories have gained him some high-profile
      supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California
      that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet.


      PayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth £1.5 billion) donated £2.4 million to de Grey''s
      anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS).
      Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing.


      While many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly

      and repair faulty genes, ''clear out the gunk around cells'' and rejuvenate
      our bodies.


      It sounds fanciful but as he talks, it is clear that de Grey is empowered by
      the support of the Silicon Valley billionaires. ''It is a good feeling to finally
      be getting validation,'' he admits.


      Many academics have dismissed his theories as pie in the sky. It should be noted
      that much of what he says is theoretical and, critics point out, de Grey has
      never actually done any practical lab work.


      De Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide (pictured) have an unconventional marriage
      and he admits to having ''two younger girlfriends''


      Nir Barsilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein
      College of Medicine, said: ''Based on the biology that we know today, somewhere
      between 100 and 120 there is a roof in play and I challenge if we can get beyond
      it.'' The oldest human to date was Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in August
      1997 at the age of 122 years 164 days.


      De Grey has been mockingly compared to a ''Messiah'' figure because of his flowing
      facial hair, and heads turn in the airport bar as he bangs his glass on the
      table and loudly pronounces that ''150,000 people die every day worldwide and
      of those people, two-thirds die of ageing one way or another. That''s 30 World
      Trade Centers every day. If I bring forward the cure for ageing by one day I''ve
      saved 100,000 lives''.


      De Grey is notoriously eccentric. He refuses to carry a mobile phone (''anti-social,
      nasty things'') and has never learned to drive due to a ''mental block''. ''Cars
      can kill people without it being the driver''s fault,'' he says. He gives interviews
      to ''spread the word'' and has written several anti-ageing books.


      Last year he featured in a critically acclaimed independent movie, The Immortalists.


      De Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide, 19 years his senior, have an unconventional
      marriage and he cheerfully admits to having ''two younger girlfriends'', aged
      45 and 24.


      Isn''t juggling the needs of three women enough to age any man prematurely?
      He laughs: ''It keeps me busy.''


      Critics argue that if he is right and we all live longer, the world''s resources
      will be stretched by overpopulation, but he hits back by saying: ''Society will
      adapt. People will have fewer children.''


      What about the cost of keeping so many people alive? ''People will continue
      to contribute to society because they will be healthier and more productive.


      ''When people think about longevity they forget about the health and then they
      start to think this whole thing is morally questionable. It might be technologically
      fanciful but all we do is medical research. I work on stopping people from getting
      sicker as they get older. The by-product of that is longevity.


      ''I have no idea if I will live to 100. I do know I''d like to have the chance
      to live to 100 when I am 99 rather than having that choice removed from me by
      declining health.'''

      scientists claim.


      At the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen
      is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy.


      But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen
      from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels.


      Hydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan
      pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new
      breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily.


      Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention.


      It uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser
      and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel.


      Lead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with
      the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was
      the waste oxygen it produces.


      Water splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate
      oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively.


      The energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as
      the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy
      again elsewhere by recombining the two.


      The new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation
      half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses
      in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process.


      It can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward
      and highly economical manner.

    text: 'Three people were injured when a broken-down bus was hit by a lorry on
      the A34 in Oxfordshire.


      Fifty people were on the First Great Western rail replacement service from Oxford
      to Didcot when it was hit at Drayton, at 00:30 GMT.


      One of the three people taken to hospital sustained serious but non life-threatening
      injuries, police said.


      The southbound carriageway has been reopened but investigations are continuing.


      The remaining passengers, who did not require hospital treatment, were taken
      to Abingdon police station.


      Passenger Rebecca Crow posted a picture of her injuries on Twitter and wrote:
      "I was on the bus, it was insane. Very thankful for no fatalities; just a bust
      up face!"


      The bus was a replacement for the 00:05 First Great Western service from Oxford
      to Didcot.


      Bus passenger Adam Graves said on Twitter: "One moment the bus power failed,
      a minute or 2 later the lorry hit us. Bus ended up part down the embankment.
      #a34"


      He later told BBC News: "It sort of jumped forward. There were people screaming
      inside.


      "Then you suddenly noticed you''re falling out of your seat - everyone was flying
      everywhere.


      "Once that initial shock had passed people were quite calm.


      "A lot of people on the bus had been coming back from a gig in Oxford, that''s
      where I''d been, that kept people calm as a few recognised each other."


      In a statement, a First Great Western spokesman said the firm was "keen" to
      offer support to all of the bus passengers and their families.


      He said initial reports from its own contractor "suggest the driver followed
      correct safety procedures", but added police were investigating.


      "We are offering them any assistance we can to understand the full details of
      the incident," he said.


      The A34 was shut between the Botley and Milton interchanges.


      It had been due to reopen at 11:00 but was delayed due to difficulties in recovering
      the vehicles, police said.


      Officers on site were having problems earlier with drivers ignoring the closure
      and driving through, according to BBC Radio Oxford travel reporter Sara Dumbell.

    text: 'In a sport beset by tiresome braggadocio, Ricky Burns seems like an impostor.


      With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer''s career seemed
      to be on the wane.


      But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at
      Glasgow''s Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight
      title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at
      three weights.


      Italy''s Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn''t lost a fight
      since September 2007.


      He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser
      figure.


      The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the
      eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made
      all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish
      fans.


      Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment
      to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him
      leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?


      No.


      Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his
      gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex
      Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate
      with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.


      "When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, ''You''ve done it! You''ve
      done it!''," reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.


      "And you know what Ricky said? ''Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer
      [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?''"


      When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense
      satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons
      and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.


      In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier
      of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions
      Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for
      example.


      Burns'' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have
      been world title fights.


      Buchanan''s exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while
      Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage
      to set up a bout against Cincinnati''s Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion
      stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could
      achieve little more in the sport.

      "I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight
      comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford
      again if it came down to it.

      Mary Cartwright was 20 when she was called up to work in the laboratory at Drakelow
      Shadow Factory in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, in 1943.


      She spent two years testing metal for Bristol aircraft engines in the site''s

      Now,  70 years after leaving her position, the 91-year-old great-grandmother
      has revisited the now defunct factory.


      Mary Cartwright revisited Drakelow Underground Factory in Kidderminster, Worcestershire,
      where more than 700 people worked during the war (right)  to produce aircraft
      engines. Now 91, the great grandmother tested metal for aircraft engines.


      Revisiting the site with her son, David, Mrs Cartwright said it was ''strange''

    text: 'Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor may have taken the spotlight over the past
      two weeks when it comes to the UFC''s featherweight division, but this weekend
      it''s time for two other top ranked 145ers to take centre stage, as No 1 ranked
      Chad Mendes and No 4 ranked Ricardo Lamas meet in Fairfax, in a bout which could
      potentially determine the next challenger to the title.


      Mendes'' only two professional losses have come at the hands of the Brazilian
      king and Lamas also dropped a decision to Aldo when the two met in February
      last year.


      But it is Aldo''s upcoming opponent, Irishman McGregor, who has dominated conversation
      in the lead up to this weekend''s fight.


      Opponents Chad Mendes and Ricardo Lamas face off during the UFC weigh-in at
      the Patriot Center.


      Lamas holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym on in
      Fairfax, Virginia.


      ''I thought Aldo handled it well'' said Team Alpha Male''s Mendes, when asked
      about Aldo''s reaction to McGregor snatching the championship belt on stage
      in Dublin. ''But that''s Conor, he is crazy, you know,'' Mendes continued.


      ''Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is
      always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that
      get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I''m good. I think Aldo is a better mixed
      martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I
      just see him winning the fight.''


      A stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing
      but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night''s main event.


      Mendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at
      the Patriot Centre.


      Mendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against
      Lamas in Fairfield.


      Anticipating a war when they meet, ''Money'' Mendes is confident that he is
      stronger than ''The Bully'' in every department and that, should he win convincingly,
      he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo.


      ''I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the
      thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I''m just that little bit
      better,'' he added.


      ''I''m hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch
      a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we''ll
      see what happens.


      ''If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough
      to get me another shot. I''m expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas
      is a tough, tough fighter.''


      Mendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax,
      Virginia.


      And Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight
      title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in
      for an easy night with Mendes.


      ''If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,'' he said. ''Mendes
      is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is
      going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you''re going to see
      us both try to go in there and take each other out.


      ''I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we
      will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we''re going to
      bring the best out of each other, for sure.''


      Lamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an
      open training session.


      Meanwhile arguably two of the lightweight division''s most exciting fighters,
      Jorge Masvidal and Al Iaquinta, meet in the co-main event - a bout which should
      showcase some of the finest striking in the division.
